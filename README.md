### Host Maps
Host Maps provide a visual representation of your entire infrastructure in terms of hosts (servers or virtual machines). 
They display how your hosts are related, how services are running, and how data flows between them.
Host Maps are designed to give you an overview of your environment,
making it easier to identify performance bottlenecks or issues in your system.

### Container Maps
Container Maps are similar to Host Maps, but instead of showing physical or virtual hosts, 
they visualize the state of your containers (e.g., Docker containers or Kubernetes pods).
Container Maps help you understand the state of your containers in real time and how they interact with other containers and services.
